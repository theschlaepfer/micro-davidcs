Got a few captions for this one.
"Jensen & Stephen: A Tale of Two Buds."
"Staring contest."
"As Jensen gazed into Stephen's eyes, he lost himself in his emotions. He had never felt this way before. He was confused, maybe a bit alarmed, but soon accepted with open arms the wonderful fact that he could really benefit from owning a marshmallow gun."
