Crazy old Maurice: Justin Timberlake style.

Guys, tonight we finished our last show of Beauty and the Beast. It's the first time I've gotten really attached to a show. The play itself was great, no doubt, but the people behind it are just incredible, funny, talented, etc. So very very thankful for these friends today.
