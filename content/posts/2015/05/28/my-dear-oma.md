My dear Oma gently passed away early this morning. When I heard the news, I was honestly filled with joy. Where she is now is so much better than anything she could have experienced here. She lived a very full life, and now she's living an even fuller eternity.

She kept a journal for a while and in one of the entries she wrote, "It makes such a difference when one believes that we live only a short time on this earth, but an eternity in heaven. And the comfort we have that one day we will see our loved ones again. I wonder if they are helping to prepare a place for us."
