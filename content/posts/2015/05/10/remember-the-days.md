Remember the days when I regularly posted photos and didn't wait several weeks between posts? I've just been so preoccupied with school and music and movie-making and tests and animations and existential crises and a whole slew of fun and not-fun life-stuff. Beginning to focus on actually living my life, and part of me is afraid of that, y'know? Life's intimidating, so I feel like I tend to use Instagram or Facebook to escape my life, when it's really best to face it head on. That's how we grow. Okay, so yeah: picture of candles = existential caption. Sorry bout that.
