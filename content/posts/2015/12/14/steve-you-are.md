Steve, you are fabulous. I'm crazy excited for the places God will take you in your next year of life. You're such a caring, compassionate dude, and you're going to do great things, mark my words (do it, mark 'em). I'm counting down the days until you come back home (not because I resent where you are, but simply because I miss you). Best of luck on your finals, und herzlichen GlÃ¼ckwunsch zum Geburtstag!
(Oh, and a word of advice from a wise man: "Don't be an angry bed. After all, everything silver has a lining".)
