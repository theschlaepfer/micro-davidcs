Desiree comforts her dog Gini as she trembles on the Diavolezza. (It's not going to get much attention, since it's not particularly Instagramy, but this is one of my favorite pictures I took on my trip to Switzerland in June. I like to imagine it was in some LIFE magazine editorial or something.) #vscocam #theschlaepferabroad
