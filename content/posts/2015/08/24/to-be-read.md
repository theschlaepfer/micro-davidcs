[To be read in a forties newsreel voice.]
Stephen embarks tomorrow for the strange, far-off land know to some as "Sea-cattle". Little is known about this fog-obscured country, but valiant Stephen fights the odds and journeys into the mists of the unknown to find the elusive "Dugri im-Arkiting". Along the way, he will use his knowledge of the Instant-Gramp to find new faces to document, and to discover new and hap places to drink the native "ko-fee".
Nevertheless, he must leave, and a single tear falls from this humble reporter's eye. Until next time, Stephen, and good luck on your courageous adventure into the mystery of "gru-wing ohp".
