Today was going to be a relaxing, "take it easy" kinda day, but then we ended up taking a bike ride over what felt like several Mt. Everests in a row and I got lost in the middle of the woods on what was definitely not a bike path for like an hour but I eventually sweated my way back to my parents and now my butt is super sore. Basically I'm not going to exercise for a month.
