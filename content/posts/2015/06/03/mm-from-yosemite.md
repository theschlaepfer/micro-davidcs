35mm from Yosemite. // In terms of efficiency and not-pain-in-the-butt-ness, digital photos are so much better, but there's definitely a certain magic about taking photos on film. The photos feel like your own, y'know? They feel like they were produced out of your own blood, sweat and tears. That's kind of gross. Never mind. You get the idea.
