It’s my first morning in Thailand. Yesterday we got some coffee (I got lychee iced coffee - so good) and for dinner ate crispy pork belly which was transcendent.

On the flight I ended up watching _A Brighter Summer Day_ and _Beau travail_. Two very different films. Both good. I feel like maybe I wasn’t quite in the right headspace for _Beau travail_ after _A Brighter Summer Day_, which is so much more rooted in reality.

Last night I offloaded the b-roll and a few interviews I shot and added metadata in Resolve, renaming the clips using Resolve’s smart renaming using the metadata I inputted. Feels good to finally use that organizational method!
