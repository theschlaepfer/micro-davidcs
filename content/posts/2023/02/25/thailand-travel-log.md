One of the more surprising things I've found on this trip is that my hotel WiFi has symmetrical up/down internet speeds of around 100 mbps. In fact, [according to Speetest.net](https://www.speedtest.net/global-index/thailand#market-analysis), Thailand as a country has a median upload speed of 172.95 mbps. There are probably flaws in this dataset, but that's still shocking. The USA [in comparison](https://www.speedtest.net/global-index/united-states?fixed#market-analysis) has a measly 22.78 mbps average upload speed.

What this means for me practically is I've been able to back up my footage every night to multiple cloud services, and it's finished before I go out in the morning. How lovely! ðŸ¥° I can only imagine how wonderful life would be if these kinds of upload speeds were available everywhere in the states. (Insert futuristic society meme.)

Also - realized today I totally should have watched _Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives_ by Apichatpong Weerasethakul, which is a Thai film. I'll watch it on the flight back!

In terms of food (the most important terms), today I ate eggs benedict for breakfast, with an iced coffee and some muesli. In the middle of the day, we went up to the mountains, met some elephants and stopped for khao soi for lunch (delicious!) with an iced latte (yes, I needed it) and mango with sticky rice as a dessert. Later, we walked through the night market on the outside of the old city. We went for Greek food at a place that you _had_ to know was there, otherwise you wouldn't find it. Down this alley and that. I had a falafel "sandwich" (and the falafels were sooo good, not too dry) and a Singha.
