Over the next six days, I'll be traveling to Chiang Mai, Thailand, to interview some missionaries that the church supports. I thought I'd keep a small travel log here for the heck of it. I don't know if I'll keep up with it but at least I've started.

Currently, I'm sitting in the international terminal at SFO waiting to board our flight. We have a 14 hr flight to Taipei and then a 4 hr connecting flight to Chiang Mai, Thailand. I've downloaded multiple movies that I've been wanting to watch but haven't because they're either too long to watch after a workday or too heavy. The films I've downloaded are:

- _Yi Yi_
- _A Brighter Summer Day_ (The longest film on the list, clocking in at just under four hours.)
- _A Touch of Zen_
- _Seven Samurai_
- _Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy_
- _Drive My Car_
- _Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters_
- _Andrei Rublev_
- _Stalker_
- _Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles_
- _Beau travail_
- _Cl√©o from 5 to 7_ (The shortest film, at an hour and a half.)
- _Metropolis_

We'll see how many of these I'll actually get around to watching. I know I need to sleep but the idea of 14 uninterrupted hours of movie watching time is a delightful prospect.

I'm traveling with some borrowed gear from the church, courtesy of [Jamie Rom](https://vimeo.com/user10667229). I have the Canon R5 shooting in 4K with CLog3 and two lenses: the Canon RF 15-35mm f/2.8 which will be my primary lens, and a 24-105mm for any time I might need a telephoto. The goal is to get tons of b-roll in addition to a solid interview. I'm shooting in 4K in the IPB Light codec flavor, mostly so as to optimize card space as I'd like to avoid formatting cards while I'm on the trip. We'll see how that goes and if I have to pivot midway.
