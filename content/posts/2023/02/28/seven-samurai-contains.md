Scattered thoughts follow.<br />- I was worried about keeping up with all the characters but found it pretty easy. Each one is very clearly and uniquely characterized and has their own individual arcs.<br />- Very satisfying watching the samurai plan and execute. Like a heist film but for village defense.<br />- The way the daisies shook while Katsushiro watched that first sword fight with the bandits was a perfect way to make the tension palpable.<br />- Wasn‚Äôt completely satisfied with the way Shino is treated. Obviously Manzo isn‚Äôt cast in the greatest light. His ‚Äúdamaged goods‚Äù line would either not be present in a modern rendition, or he would have been strongly rebuked by the samurai. Instead it‚Äôs sort of left unspoken, and it seems Shino might never recover from the shame. A smaller tragedy in the grander tragedy this movie tells.<br />- Teared up when Kikuchiyo was holding the village orphan. He went from my least favorite character to top three at least by the end of the film. Now That‚Äôs What I Call Character Redemption¬ÆÔ∏é.<br />- Even in small village skirmishes, war is hell.</p>
