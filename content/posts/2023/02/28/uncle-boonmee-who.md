Some impressions:<br />- Eerie but never unsettling. Matches well the feeling of knowing death is coming.<br />- ‚ÄúAre you excited?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the same as when I would give a presentation.‚Äù<br />- Reminds me of <i>Shape of Water</i> because... well... you know why...<br />- Why did Jen and Tong have the out of body experience at the end? Maybe is it a manifestation of how detached you feel after someone close dies?<br />- I read this was the final installment in a series of projects by the director. Would love to watch the rest but I don‚Äôt know where to find them.</p>
