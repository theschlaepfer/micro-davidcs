Every character has such unique arcs. I felt especially moved by the father‚Äôs very flawed character. He sees himself as a male chick in grave danger of being discarded. His actions are seen through that lens ‚Äì his need to prove his worth and usefulness to his family. But that drive just pushes them further away. It‚Äôs a terrible trap to fall into.</p>
