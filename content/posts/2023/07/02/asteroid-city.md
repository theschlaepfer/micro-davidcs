This is a dramatization of a play within a made-up story about a playwright within a local television station‚Äôs evening programming. Still, it‚Äôs so easy to forget that, as the actors (or the actors of the actors of the actors) play their parts so well, I found myself getting emotionally invested in the fate of an urn that was simply a Tupperware prop of a prop of a prop.</p><p>If none of this makes sense to you, don‚Äôt worry. It doesn‚Äôt make much sense to me either - or even to some of the characters of the film. This is a movie about accepting that strange things happen. That events and occurrences in our life often cause us to wake up to a different reality, or realize that perhaps we had been sleeping without knowing it. It‚Äôs about getting outside of your head. Which is a remarkable theme for a director who - I‚Äôm convinced - has a cross-sectioned diorama for a brain.</p><p>Remarkably funny throughout with some very magical and chilling moments that took my breath away. Despite that, the gestalt of it still falls somewhere below his masterpieces (which are, in my opinion, and in some sort of rough order, <i>Grand Budapest</i>, <i>Mr Fox</i>, <i>Moonrise Kingdom</i>, <i>Tenenbaums</i>).</p><p>‚Äî</p><p>As a side note, the theater I saw this in (Scotts Valley CineLux) didn‚Äôt have its surround system working properly. So unless this movie was mixed in mono (wouldn‚Äôt put it past Wes) there‚Äôs a good chance I missed some important audio cues. üòí Indy earlier today (same theater) had rough sound too.</p>
