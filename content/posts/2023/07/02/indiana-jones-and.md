But overall a really fun popcorn flick, which is all this franchise was ever meant to be at its core. The couple next to us were “oof, that’s gotta hurt!”-ing and “oh no no no!”-ing at every punch or gun pull, and while I was initially peeved I sort of grew to accept that that’s the whole point of these films. Although I’m looking forward to a rewatch where I don’t have them talking in my ear and where I can pause to use the restroom.</p><p>Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Harrison Ford totally nail it, and Mads does his thing well. Direction is solid, but the plot could have used some clarity. I suppose that’s to be expected from a movie in development for more than a decade.</p><p>Last thing I’ll say is: I’ll be glad when the de-aging trend goes away.</p>
