It would be wrong of me to let a Sufjan release go by without urging people to [listen to it](https://sufjanstevens.lnk.to/javelin). What a perfect way to enter autumn.

This is arguably his most accessible album in a decade, not only musically but lyrically. It‚Äôs not at all as pretentious and historical as _Illinois_, and not quite as depressive as _Carrie & Lowell_ (although, I have to briefly defend that album‚Äôs depressiveness by saying that ‚ÄúFourth of July,‚Äù with it‚Äôs lovely choral refrain of ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all gonna die,‚Äù is one of my most listened songs, and pulled me through some very hard times). [Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sufjan-stevens-javelin/) put it nicely:

> If the lyrics on _Javelin_ lack the proper-noun touchstones of Stevens‚Äô story-songs, these ones gain authority from an intrinsic sense of self and place. They are approachable like pop songs, but delivered with the same precision as his folk confessionals. They break our hearts from within.

I should also mention [the dedication to his late partner Evans Richardson](https://sufjan.com/post/730446434104754176/sufjan-stevens-javelin). There‚Äôs not a lot I can add to this. I can just say I really appreciate Sufjan‚Äôs transparency through such a difficult time of life. _Javelin_ makes it clear that it wasn‚Äôt always an easy relationship, and he says as much in his post:

> I know relationships can be very difficult sometimes, but it‚Äôs always worth it to put in the hard work and care for the ones you love, especially the beautiful ones, who are few and far between. If you happen to find that kind of love, hold it close, hold it tight, savor it, tend to it, and give it everything you‚Äôve got, especially in times of trouble. Be kind, be strong, be patient, be forgiving, be vigorous, be wise, and be yourself. Live every day as if it is your last, with fullness and grace, with reverence and love, with gratitude and joy. This is the day the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it.
