<p>Just finished <em>The Second Sleep</em> by Robert Harris. Really intriguing premise and immersive setting, but a weird and rocky ending.</p>
<p>This is the second book I‚Äôve read this year (the first being <em>How Do You Live</em> by Genzabur≈ç Yoshino, in prep for <em>The Boy and the Heron</em>). It‚Äôs also the second book I‚Äôve read since high school. üò¨ I like reading, but other forms of entertainment usually take priority for me.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a goal of mine to read more this year and next, so please let me know if you have suggestions!</p>
