On one hand, you have very explicit reflexivity like <i>F for Fake </i>and nostalgia like <i>Cinema Paradiso</i>¬†or <i>The Fabelmans</i>. On the other hand is a more subtle reflexivity, like the monolith and interstellar trip of <i>2001</i>¬†and the hidden, behind-the-scenes reflexivity of the probably hundreds of obsessive, possibly self-destructive actors/directors/screenwriters who have slaved away creating films about obsessive, definitely self-destructive characters ‚Äî¬†<i>Fitzcarraldo, The Phantom Thread, </i>probably every Wes Anderson film, and definitely anything Charlie Kaufman makes.</p><p>Any work of art reflects the human beings involved in its creation. This transcends film - writing, painting, interactive media and music all carry this same fingerprint. But (at the moment) film is the only way to capture¬†that behind the scenes hidden truth.</p><p>Or‚Ä¶ is it? By turning the camera away from the actors and towards the director, do they just become another actor? What about the sound recordist or the camera operator? This is¬†<i>Symbiopsychotaxiplasm</i>, an incredibly silly film at its core about the act of observing anything, or being watched by anything, and how that changes everything or maybe nothing at all.</p>
