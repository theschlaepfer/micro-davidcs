I’m always so hesitant to watch - surely they’d be dated by now. But with <em>The Passion of Joan of Arc</em>, Chaplin’s silent films, and now this, I’m ditching that skepticism for good. What an awesome film. Terrible in the biblical sense. Strikingly relevant even today.</p><p>Favorite moments (incomplete and in no order):</p><p><ul><li>The legend of THE TOWER OF BABEL” - what a beautifully framed sequence (literally, love the creative vignette), and a really interesting take on the story.</li><li>Freder’s struggle over the clock. The end of his shift is seconds away... and then the hands of the clock move backwards. Everyone who’s worked a day in their life can relate.</li><li>Brigitte Helm!! What a crazy performance. To swing between two extremes of acting like that... just incredible. Also... Saoirse Ronan is clearly her reincarnated.</li><li>“MOLOCH!”</li><li>The chase scene in the catacombs. Very inventive use of light and framing. Brigitte Helm’s movements are almost dance-like.</li><li>Speaking of dance-like... the robot Maria’s dancing is hilarious. Literally the most goofy dancing caught on film and all the dudes in attendance are like 👁️🫦👁️</li><li>The creatively animated intertitles were incredible. A lost art for sure.</li><li>The montage of the eyes and then of the faces watching the robot Maria.</li></ul></p>
