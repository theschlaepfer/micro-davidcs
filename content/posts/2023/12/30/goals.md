This is a non-comprehensive list of some things I want to achieve in the new year. Maybe I’ll set reminders to check in on this as the year goes on.

## Downsize
I want less stuff. Every time we move there’s a box or two full of random stuff that just sits in another box or drawer until we move again. Not great! But also so tedious to go through! I'd love to take a week and just really decide what things I need, and what things are weighing me down. And also figure out eBay.

## Read a book each month
I read my first full books since high school this year, and I enjoyed it a lot. I always envy readers and bookworms. I have a lot of other media I like that can eat away at my free time (games, shows, films). Zelda especially has just torpedoed my free time. I’ve loved every second of it, but wow is there a lot to do in that game.

Getting off topic. Point is: time short, want read book. I got a couple for Christmas so I'll start there! To make it more of a tangible goal, I'll try to read one book each month. I can already tell you I'll fail but at least it gives me a framework.

## Brush up on a language
I took three different languages in school: Spanish in junior high, Latin in high school, and German in college. I’d like to brush up on either **Spanish** or **German** in the new year.

**Spanish** is vastly more practical for me because of where I live, and would be used weekly if not daily.

**German** is of interest to me because my family is from Switzerland. Ideally I’d love to learn the **Swiss-German** my extended family speaks, but learning resources are scarce. And nearly all of them are fluent in English so it’s not a pressing matter. Just would feel nice to connect more with that family history.

Then there’s an entirely impractical side of me that wants to learn **Japanese**. Japan is the Switzerland of Asia in a lot of ways and visiting this past summer made me want to go back so badly. Probably has the most uphill battle to learn though, so maybe I’ll leave that for another year.

My tentative plan is to put on some videos and such while I do dishes or other chores, when my ears and brain are a captive audience!

## Establish a workout rhythm
This is such the stereotypical New Year’s resolution, but yeah, I’d like to get fit. Specifically, _I want to know what it’s like to feel “in shape”._ Especially since becoming a father, there are so many things in my daily life that I think would be so much easier if my muscles were just a bit stronger or my heart and lungs a little more efficient.

How am I going to do this? Not sure yet. There’s a gym club near us that offers childcare so I might try that for a bit. I’ve tried running before and I liked it when I could find the time for it. And Fitness+ gets flack but I’ve done quite a few exercises through it and it’s honestly quite enjoyable.

I’ll end up doing a combo. Or nothing at all. But maybe me saying this into the internet will provide some sense of accountability. Ideally I just want to get into a sustainable rhythm. Doesn't have to be much, just something.

## Use public transit?
This is a tough one for me. Right now I live in the mountains on a somewhat steep, busy, and narrow road with a lot of blind turns. This makes riding a bike a bit treacherous from my home, especially after dark. When the days start to get longer, I'd like to try riding my bike to the bus station and ride the bus to work more often. It tags on quite a bit of extra time in my commute, but I've just grown to really resent driving recently. Tough in a car-dependent area of a car-dependent nation.

## Unlock the power of Costco
At the end of this year we went to Costco a few times and I forgot how much is there in terms of building blocks for easy meals. I want to come up with some meal plans using Costco stuff to cut down on grocery costs and also make dinner a bit easier at the end of the day.

Well that's about it. I have some other vague goals of journaling or meditating but I can't really put it into words yet.

See you in a few months, wall of text.
