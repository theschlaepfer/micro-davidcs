I laughed quite a bit more than I thought I would and the chemistry between the leads is pretty good. Love the Khan family, easily stole every scene they were in. The plotting is very rough and the final act is extremely ho hum (these heroes <i>really</i> need to start by talking with the “bad guys” and seeing how they can help with their problems). But that’s pretty much par for the course for Marvel.</p><p>At the end of the day, I got to sit in a theater and forget about work and eat some candy. Sometimes that’s all my dodo brain needs. 🦤</p>
