<p>Three years and some months ago I had a big editing project I was wrapping up while finishing college and pulled a lot of late nights. Carly Rae Jepsen’s “Dedicated Side B” pulled me through those nights in a very real way.</p>
<p>Now it’s almost 2 AM and I’m wrapping up a (much smaller) project, and The Loveliest Time is pulling me through. Something about her music is just so perfect for this setting. It’s dancey and joyful but also very suited for nighttime somehow. 🙏 Thanks Carly.</p>
