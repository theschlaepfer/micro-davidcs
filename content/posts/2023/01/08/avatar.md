The narration is dumb and schlocky. The villains are tropey and over the top. The main character is more bland than toast without butter.</p><p>Somehow this still struck a chord in me despite it‚Äôs very clear failings. I think something about Pandora is so magical. And the message is more relevant than ever. Wish I could have seen this in theaters, but it does put a fire under me to get out and see the second in theaters before it leaves.</p>
