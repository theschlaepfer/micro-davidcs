Quite fun. Story’s alright but mostly sits backseat to the gameplay. I grew up on the Jedi Knight games so it felt really good to get back to that type of Star Wars game. Nothing is quite as satisfying as force pushing a bunch of Storm Troopers off a ledge. 😌

I do think some of the criticism around level design makes sense. I thought it was mostly really great but there were a few repetitive moments in backtracking and such. I know they wanted it to feel like a cross between Dark Souls and Metroid, but I don’t know that the Metroidvania type level design lends itself as well to this kind of blockbuster storytelling. I’d rather they took an Uncharted 4 approach but 🤷‍♂️ we’ll see where the next one goes!
