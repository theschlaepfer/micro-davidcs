Really spectacular. A perfect game for this stormy weather. The voice acting and sound design really elevates it to an impressive narrative, but the core loop is just purely addicting. I saw one review compare it to Sudoku which is surprisingly accurate. Like Clue meets Sudoku. I will forever remember the jingle that plays when you guess three fates correctly.
