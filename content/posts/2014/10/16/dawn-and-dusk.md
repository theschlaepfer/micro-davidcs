Dawn and dusk are my favorite times of day. Not because of the light, in fact I prefer the times just before or after the good light. I like these times because the world seems to be in transition from the hustle-and-bustle of high noon and the sound sleep of midnight. These bookends of the day are when the world is the most peaceful, when everything is surreally real, and when I feel like I've got nothing I need to do but enjoy the view.
