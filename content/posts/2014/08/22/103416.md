They're in looooove. (Last night we swam with manta rays. The most beautiful thing I've seen in the ocean. There were all these scuba divers with lights pointed up and these huge schools of fish were swimming through the lights and there was plankton everywhere and a bunch of bubbles from the scuba divers and it was like an underwater light show. Unforgettable.)
