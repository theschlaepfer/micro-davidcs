Meet Milton, the cat with thumbs. Actually, Milton is a polydactyl cat, which means he was born with a genetic mutation that gives him extra toes. Milton lies out on the bike path I use to get home every now and then, and each time has rubbed against my leg when I stop, and let's me scratch his head. He also runs after me when I leave, which makes it oh so hard to go. Thank you, Milton, for making my trip back home so much cooler. #storyportrait
