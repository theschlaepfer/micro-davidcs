Although I wonder what it would’ve been like with two leads that were actually singers. Not that they didn’t do a good job... but it definitely brought it down a notch. <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/hellfire/1270209325?i=1270210013" rel="nofollow">Patrick Page</a> steals the show with one (half of a) song.</p><p>Then again, you’d miss out on the really fun winking humor Ferrell and Reynolds bring to it. Sometimes I wonder if I’m getting fatigued by that style of tongue-firmly-buried-in-the-cheek humor. I mean, it’s pretty much Reynolds’ typecast at this point. But this felt fun to me, and genuine in a way that, say, <a href="https://boxd.it/2F6i9d" rel="nofollow"><i>Free Guy</i></a> wasn’t.</p><p>I do want to say... there’s a certain plot point towards the end of Act Two that’s just... 👀. A bit roughly handled.</p><p>I’ve immediately forgotten all the music but I didn’t completely hate it in the moment! And I’m a real sucker for that final shot. 💕 Merry Christmas!</p>
