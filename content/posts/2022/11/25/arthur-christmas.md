Some of the funniest gags in a Christmas movie for sure. And honestly a pretty touching moment at the end. It's a bit of an information overload at times with hyper visuals and quick-firing dialogue (a similar feeling I had watching <i><a href="https://letterboxd.com/theschlaepfer/film/the-mitchells-vs-the-machines/" rel="nofollow">The Mitchells vs. The Machines</a></i>... am I just getting old?) but overall very sweet, very funny, and very much going to be a Christmas staple from here on out.</p>
