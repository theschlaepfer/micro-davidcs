[Criterion added a slew of films to its streaming site for Sony Pictures Classics’ 30th anniversary](https://www.criterionchannel.com/30-years-of-art-house-hits-a-tribute-to-sony-pictures-classics). There are a few in here I’ve seen but a lot more I’ve been waiting to see. On my watchlist:

- _Persepolis_
- _Run Lola Run_
- _Orlando_
- _Paprika_
- _Volver_

If I get around to watching them (which is tough as a new parent working full-time and going into the holidays), I’ll be logging them [on my Letterboxd account](https://letterboxd.com/theschlaepfer/). (I wonder if there’s a Letterboxd → Micro.blog crossposting tool?)
