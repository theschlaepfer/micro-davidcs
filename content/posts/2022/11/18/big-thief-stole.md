If you aren’t yet acquainted with [Big Thief](https://bigthief.net) and by extension [Adrianne Lenker](https://www.adriannelenker.com/), I suggest you have some acquaintin’ to do. They make delightful music that walks the line between folk & rock & electronic & country & most of the subgenres within. Their [latest album](https://bigthief.ffm.to/dnwmibiy.owe) has been on my rotation all year. Plus it has the dorkiest cover. 

When I first heard them I was like [“Yeah whatever, you’re sort of pitchy.”](https://youtu.be/UkiI2vM2lfA?t=134) But now they’re one of the few bands I call myself a fan of.

A few of my favorites:

- [Mary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5OV1JPqlNQ). A quiet storybook hymn. Best enjoyed with headphones in a dark room.
- [Shark Smile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1QlOfYxykI). Contains the most wonderful “woo!”
- [No Reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MumyOxKPrTE). Listen for the sing-along chorus. Stick around for the sick flute solo.
- [Two Hands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eElc7PX63xQ). Clappity clap clap. Great percussion.
- [Time Escaping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkIvGej2WyI). Bonkers track.
- [Terminal Paradise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B77YDZwMV4). Really great build.
- [Red Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMD2OGlgAEg). Leans hard into hoedown mode. That link is a video of them recording it live.

And a handful from Adrianne:

- [from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjB3Qwjcimw). Just haunting. Get’s the [full band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DM74fc2Umo0) treatment also.
- [not a lot, just forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsl9IZxxY0I). Really sweet love song. Makes me swoon.
- [forwards beckon rebound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cYWc_wzuiU). Showcases Adrianne’s rhythmic fingerpicking.
