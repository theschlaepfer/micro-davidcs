This feels like a story torn between two movies: one an emotional drama about losing a loved one and a leader that needs to deliver on a promise to provide solace and introspection to the audience, the other a blockbuster action flick that needs to deliver on a promise to provide spectacle to the audience. Ultimately it underdelivers in both camps. I feel as though Ryan Coogler wanted to make a more intimate Shuri-focused film, evidenced by several scenes that feel integral to her development as a character but maybe not relevant to the development of the primary storyline with Namor. Thereâ€™s just too much going on that steals that focus away, with Ironheart and Julia-Louis Dreyfussâ€™s storylines in particular tugging away at the frayed edges. By the time the video-game-action-figure-green-screen-epic-battle rolls around, I knew it was time to finally take that pee break(2) because nothing would happen for the next ten minutes.</p><p>(1) Not like <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania/" rel="nofollow">Quantumania</a>.<br />(2) I do not recommend watching a movie about ocean people with liquid bombs and trickling, gurgling sfx when ya gotta go ðŸ˜•</p>
