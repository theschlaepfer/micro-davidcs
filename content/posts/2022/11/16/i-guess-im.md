I was born too late to know the height of blogs in the mid-00s. However I **have** seen *Julie & Julia* and I **do** have delusions of grandeur. So here I am. Where once I simply tweeted my thoughts into the abyss, I shall now blog them furiously into an even abyssier abyss. I’ll probably regret it 👍

Hoping to blog about all sorts of things. Whatever’s interesting to me, I guess. I imagine it’ll mostly revolve around video editing, [which I do for a living](www.dcscreative.com). I also [enjoy](www.instagram.com/theschlaepfer) taking [photos](pixelfed.social/@theschlaepfer) for [fun](https://vs.co/f05t2k7m), but I wouldn’t say I’m a photographer. Similarly, I’ve recently been making a simple app for the [Playdate](https://play.date) called [The Drawing Board](https://theschlaepfer.itch.io/the-drawing-board), but I’m **definitely** not a developer. I love hearing developers talk tho, and love using beautiful apps. Currently, I’m typing this in Ulysses, which I haven’t cracked open since college. It’s refreshing. :)

See ya ✌️
