Always appreciate superhero fight scenes that are actually thought out.</p><p>There‚Äôs a particular shot in this of Harriet Sansom Harris towards the beginning that‚Äôs just immaculately lit. Combined with the grainy b&amp;w effect, it just nails the look. I just wish it continued that look throughout. This is an <i>homage</i> to classic horror, but it only really <i>emulates</i> classic horror in very specific moments (the dolly in on Laura Donnelly being another). It really does skew more Marvel than Universal in its DNA.</p><p>But it‚Äôs still fun! A nice short lil spooky story. Also love love love the trope of the good guy being pals with a misunderstood monster. Just always hits right. üòå</p>
