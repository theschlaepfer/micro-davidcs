Leo is really believable as Walken’s son. He brings that in his performance as well – aside from the accent, there are some tics that are very subtle but very accurate to Christopher Walken.<br />- “What‘s she gonna be? A shoe salesman at a centipede farm?”<br />- “Frank… you’re not a Lutheran?”<br />- Throughout the year, if Anna and I are talking and someone who’s named Frank comes up in convo, I have like this muscle memory impulse to say “Frahnk. Frahnk. Hahd you pass the bah in Lwisiana Frahnk.”</p>
