The best writing of any game Iâ€™ve played, hands down. The world is so fascinating and original, textured and many-faceted. It takes a long time to get through (esp. with the voice acting - I canâ€™t allow myself to cut people off) but I actually enjoyed taking it slow. Taking the scenic route, poking around in unlikely places for more information. There are a lot of subtle twists that happen through this - moments where my eyes were wide, waiting for the next turn in a tense conversation. Small, seemingly insignificant pieces of information can cause a ripple effect to dramatically shift the way you once perceived the story thus far, your character, and even the world you inhabit.
