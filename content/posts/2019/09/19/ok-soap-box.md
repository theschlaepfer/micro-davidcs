ok, soap box time.

my wife (!) opened her gallery show this week to cap off her bachelor's of fine arts program. anna poured so much effort into this show, pretty much just hitting the ground running right after our honeymoon. through so much difficulty (getting dropped from all her classes, an earlier show date than expected, advisors not showing up for meetings, artwork falling off the walls, and much much more), she has stayed so strong and determined to finish this semester well. i'm so so proud of her, and this show is a triumph and testament to her hard work throughout her school career.

i love you @annakatherine. i can't wait to see where your art takes you (and us!)
