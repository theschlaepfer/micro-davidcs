i took this (and my last two posts) with an old f/1.4 50mm lens connected to an adapter connected to another adapter connected to my gh5. it ended up being v unruly and focus was kind of all over the place because of the wacky flange depth and maybe the crop factor but it gave a really dreamy vibe to everything. feeling like i'm gonna take more pictures with this setup. prolly talking to a wall here but that's the internet. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
