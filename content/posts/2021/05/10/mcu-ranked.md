<p>Ok look it’s not the greatest thing to sweep cinema but several of these are halfway decent and I need something to talk to my family about.</p> <ol> <li> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/avengers-endgame/">Avengers: Endgame</a> <p>A great way to go “out”. Takes its time to examine grief and loss in a way that’s surprising from such a blockbuster. Star Wars Episode IX… take notes.</p> </li> <li> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/loki-2021/">Loki</a> </li> <li> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-avengers-2012/">The Avengers</a> <p>Didn’t like this when it first came out, but honestly it’s fantastic. This feels like the best time the MCU fully cashed in on the sensation of so many different heroes with really unique strengths and abilities. Well choreographed, and comparable to <i>Incredibles</i> when it comes to good superhero fight scenes. Do wish the Chitauri were more visually interesting. Would have made it a 4.5 honestly.</p> </li> <li> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2/">Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</a> </li> <li> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/hawkeye-2021/">Hawkeye</a> </li> <li> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/wandavision/">WandaVision</a> </li> <li> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/captain-america-civil-war/">Captain America: Civil War</a> <p>Feels like a precursor to Endgame in the way it drastically shifts the tone of the whole Marvel Universe. Zemo is critically underdeveloped, but the focus on diplomacy and fallout of our heroes’ and antiheroes’ actions gives the film a great sense of emotional weight.</p> </li> <li> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/iron-man-3/">Iron Man 3</a> </li> <li> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/ms-marvel/">Ms. Marvel</a> </li> <li> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/shang-chi-and-the-legend-of-the-ten-rings/">Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</a> </li> </ol> <p>...plus 23 more. <a href="https://letterboxd.com/theschlaepfer/list/mcu-ranked/">View the full list on Letterboxd</a>.</p>
