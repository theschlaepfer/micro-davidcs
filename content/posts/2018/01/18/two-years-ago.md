Two years ago, you were going to go to Biola, I couldn't drive, and neither of us had ever had a job.
.
Since then, you've moved to another city, I began college, and we worked at a summer camp together. We've grown so much over what simultaneously feels like a day and a lifetime.
.
Two years ago, we held hands for the first time, and my world changed.
