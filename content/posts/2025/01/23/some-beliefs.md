Feels like a good time to put a few of my beliefs in writing. A very incomplete list.

1. I believe in a loving God that wants us to love others. This is something that I feel very strongly. I am a Christian and want to follow after the example for living that Christ left.
2. I believe that LGBTQ+ people deserve the same human rights as everyone else. That they are deserving of love, peace and recognition. That people _need_ to have the right to choose what they do with their own bodies, and deserve respect.
3. I believe that these first two points are not in conflict with each other, and in fact are stronger taken together. I disagree with those who force these positions into two warring factions, and _especially_ with those who use the Christian faith as a tool to oppress people.
4. We need more trains.
