Finished reading [The Honjin Murders](https://micro.blog/books/9781782275015) by Seishi Yokomizo ðŸ“š

Fun, lightweight read - finished it in two sittings. A nice way to start my goal of reading a book each month. It was a bit difficult at times to wrap my head around the terminology, especially because the murders are intrinsically connected to traditional Edo-era building design. But the translation is explanatory in a way that feels fairly natural. Iâ€™m not entirely certain of the history of the book but it feels like it must have been a serial release because nearly every chapter ends on a cliffhanger. In any case, Iâ€™m looking forward to reading more like this!
