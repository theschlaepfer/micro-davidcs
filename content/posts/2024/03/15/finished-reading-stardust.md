Finished reading: [Stardust](https://micro.blog/books/9780061142024) by Neil Gaiman 📚

A fun cat-and-mouse-and-bigger-cat adventure. It took me a little while to settle into the rhythm of it. Things just happen, supernatural stuff hidden in the prose, and you kind of think, “Did I just read that?” Just like Tristran (a name unpronounceable in my mind) might have thought, “Did I just see that?” But once you learn to roll with it and let it wash over you it’s wonderful. The ending is a bit anticlimactic, but I think that's ok. It reads more like a legend than a blockbuster so that works in its favor, I think.
