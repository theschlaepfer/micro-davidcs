I think the opening scene was interesting, but then the two exposition dump scenes that followed were actually shockingly boring. Usually these movies are great at the ‚Äúshow, don‚Äôt tell‚Äù thing. Or at least ‚Äúshow while telling‚Äù. But instead we have a three minute scene of two photographs, a cassette player, and Tom Cruise moving his eyes.</p><p>There are a few other moments like that in the hours that follow (and I have my own dislikes of certain plotting decisions or editing choices), but crucially, the action is still as exciting as ever. And that‚Äôs really what we‚Äôre all here for, right? I‚Äôve enjoyed the way the McQuarrie movies has melded the intrigue and cat-and-mouse nature of De Palma‚Äôs original film with the pure spectacle extravaganza of Brad Bird‚Äôs. It hits a really nice balance for me.</p><p>This one might be a little low on the spectacle, but it‚Äôs one of two parts. Gotta save the biggest stuff for last. I expect to read a news story about Tom Cruise falling off of a satellite or something this year.</p>
