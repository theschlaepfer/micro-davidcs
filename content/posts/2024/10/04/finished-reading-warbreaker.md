Finished reading: [Warbreaker](https://micro.blog/books/9780765320308) by Brandon Sanderson ðŸ“š

I actually finished reading this a while ago. I liked it a lot. Enough to maybe continue on the Brandon Sanderson journey a bit. Some things are a bit dated - especially in the way he wrote his female lead characters. I found it hard to break into at first since itâ€™s so heavy on exposition, but the twists partway through were genuinely surprising and renewed interest for me.
