My friend and co-worker Julian Pizarro was hit by a car while jogging on Friday. He is currently in a coma and we donâ€™t know the extent of his injuries. His wife Jessica and his three kids (triplets - Friday was their birthday) could use a lot of support right now. They have a [GoFundMe page here](https://gofund.me/8fecb3a9). Please consider helping this sweet family.
