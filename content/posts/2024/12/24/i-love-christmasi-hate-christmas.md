Christmas is a weird time of year for me. I flip flop between being excited/festive and being depressed/cynical. I think many feel the same. It can be an awful combination of high expenses, dreary weather, small talk with friends you once knew but can’t _really_ connect with anymore, family members missed, and unspoken expectations that weren’t met. But at the same time, everything is bathed in twinkly lights, beautiful colors, warm music, big hugs, and so much to eat. High highs and low lows.

Maybe that’s why _A Charlie Brown Christmas_ has such a cultural relevance, even at nearly sixty years old. This is not a new phenomenon, feeling left behind by the season. If Chuck can overcome it, I can too.
