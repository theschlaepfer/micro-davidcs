## What happened?
Lots! We moved to a new house in the Live Oak area of Santa Cruz. I visited Zambia, Morocco, and Albania (passing through South Africa, Dubai, and Germany). I had a lot of projects through work that I feel proud of. Our two-year-old became a three-year-old. I got into soccer (NWSL/EPL). Anna got _very_ into knitting and quilting. We took a couple lovely trips to Lake Tahoe and to Mendocino in the summer.

In the midst of all of that I also dealt with grief & loss, financial difficulty, deep political anxiety, heavy workloads and an ever-present lack of sleep. I anticipate all of these will appear again in the next year. Not trying to be pessimistic, but noting for myself that I experienced these hardships and still came out the other side feeling like it was overall a good year.

## What media did I consume?
(Nom nom nom.)

### Music
Bonny Light Horseman‚Äôs [**_Keep Me on Your Mind/See You Free_**](https://blh.lnk.to/keep-me-on-your-mind-see-you-free) is my album of the year. Also really loved Jessica Pratt‚Äôs _Here in the Pitch_, Khruangbin‚Äôs _A La Sala_, Soccer Mommy‚Äôs _Evergreen_, Adrianne Lenker‚Äôs _Bright Future_, Los Campesinos‚Äô _All Hell_, The Decemberists‚Äô _As It Ever Was, So It Will Be Again_, Waxahatchee‚Äôs _Tiger Blood_, Yasmin Williams‚Äô _Acadia_, and Bon Iver‚Äôs _SABLE, - EP_, in no particular order. And‚Ä¶ yes‚Ä¶ _Brat_ too. I have a [favorites playlist here on Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/best-of-2024/pl.u-6MbeFZl3mrl).

### TV
Anna and I are absolutely freaking out over [**_Silo_**](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/silo/umc.cmc.3yksgc857px0k0rqe5zd4jice) right now, so I guess that‚Äôs my show of the year. I also really enjoyed _Trying_, though we haven‚Äôt finished the last season yet, and _Bad Monkey_, which was really fun.

### Movies
I watched six movies released this year. My ratings are tied for first between [_Dune: Part Two_](https://davidcs.net/2024/08/29/dune-part-two.html "2024-08-29") and [_Wicked_](https://davidcs.net/2024/12/14/wicked.html), both great movies. But I think I‚Äôd give the edge to [**_Wicked_**](https://davidcs.net/2024/12/14/wicked.html "2024-12-14") for my favorite. I also really enjoyed [_Inside Out 2_](https://davidcs.net/2024/07/19/inside-out.html "2024-07-19").

### Games
I don‚Äôt think I played anything that released in 2024. But I did play a few older games: _The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom_, _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Remastered_, _Super Mario Bros. Wonder_, _Stray_, most of _Grim Fandango Remastered_ (until it soft locked me üò¢), and just a smidgen of _Red Dead Redemption 2_. I don‚Äôt really have a ton of time to play games, and I have a massive backlog of purchases. Like most people I guess!

## Did I meet my goals?
Yes and no:

**Downsize** ‚úÖ - But we need to do it again!

**Read a book each month** ‚ùå - I failed this. But I did end up reading seven books and am on an eighth. Probably better than any other year of my life after high school!

**Brush up on a language** ‚ùå - I tried a few times, but couldn‚Äôt establish a routine. I ended up traveling through Germany this year and also attending a few Spanish-language events. In both instances, I was kicking myself for not learning these languages. There‚Äôs a possibility of both this year again, so I‚Äôm going to try and recommit to this.

**Establish a workout rhythm** ‚úÖ‚ùå - Going to put both a check and an X here because I _did_ have a great routine, mostly through jogging and riding my bike to work. But this fall has been a really hard one mentally, so my desire to exercise has plummeted. But I know how good it feels now, so there‚Äôs hopefully less friction to get back into it.

**Use public transit** ‚ùå - The distance I live from work right now is a funny one. It‚Äôs about 10 minutes by car, 20 minutes by bike, and 30-40 minutes by bus. So bike or car tends to win out for this, as much as I‚Äôd like to kick my car dependency to the curb.

**Unlock the power of Costco** ‚ùå - We did do some meal planning for a bit that centered around Costco‚Äôs crazy good price for rotisserie chicken. Cut down on grocery cost a bit. But‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs also so much there that‚Äôs tempting in the way of cheap clothes and snacks and crap. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm disciplined enough to avoid spending a ton there on stuff I don‚Äôt need.

## What are my goals for 2025?
### Post a picture everyday
Over on [Glass](https://glass.photo), a good amount of people will do photo-a-day challenges, where, for a full year, they take a photo and post it each day. I‚Äôve heard from a few people that this starts as a good excuse to get out and walk about and stretch yourself photographically, but it turns into a burden. And you know what I need more of in my life? More burdens. So I‚Äôm going to try it out for a bit. If it sucks, it sucks and I‚Äôll drop it.

### Stick to Bullet Journaling
For Christmas I got the Leuchtturm 1917 Bullet Journal, which is hefty and beautiful and came with a sweet pen. I like handwriting notes, especially when I‚Äôm in a face-to-face meeting, and I like the tactile nature of it. BuJo as a philosophy interests me, especially the ability to expand and rework it to fit your own needs. It‚Äôs like the Notion of pen-and-paper note-taking systems. (What _doesn‚Äôt_ interest me is the courses and books etc. offered by the company or by productivity influencers‚Ä¶ but I get it. People gotta eat.)

### Redesign my site
I hesitate putting this as a goal, because it‚Äôs really more of an inevitability. I updated my site in a lot of ways this past year, mostly in colors and fonts. But I‚Äôd like to do a rethink of the flow of the site, to be a bit more useful as a portfolio as well as a blog. I want it to be simple and beautiful, a way to showcase my images and video work just as well as my words. I think I can manage it, it‚Äôs more about finding the time!

### Get back out there - running & biking
So I established jogging as a viable exercise routine last year. I also moved to a lovely area of town with plenty of quiet streets ‚Äì much better than the busy mountain road we lived on a year ago. My goal for this year is to stick with it! I have a tentative desire to run in some kind of 5K/10K kind of thing, of which there are plenty in our area. We‚Äôll see.

As for biking, I just love it. I have a 7 speed city bike and a pannier bag and everything. I have jealousy for e-bikes because there are a few big, unavoidable hills on my route. But I can do it, it‚Äôs all there in my legs! I just need to tap into it.

### Budget for ‚Äúme time‚Äù
This one is a bit wishy washy. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm really going to go about it. But part of the reason I couldn‚Äôt read a book a month last year (other than my achingly slow reading speed) is that it‚Äôs hard to find the time for it. Between video editing/producing, doing dishes, washing laundry, dealing with our threenager, getting groceries, doing the dishes again, folding that laundry that‚Äôs been sitting there for a week, etc‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just hard.

And that‚Äôs that! We‚Äôll see where I am a year from now when I write the next yearly update. ‚úåÔ∏è
