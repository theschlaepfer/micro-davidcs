There‚Äôs an alternate universe version of this that is hammed up to 11 and maybe includes a musical number that I would love to see. Fight scenes were an utter mess, absolute hot garbage (with the exception of one sequence where a snowman‚Äôs carrot gets forcibly grilled). But tucked away in there was some great art direction, especially with Krampus‚Äôs lair. Some genuinely fantastic prosthetics work.</p><p>Stream it.</p>
