Finished reading: [The Hero of Ages](https://micro.blog/books/9780575097766) by Brandon Sanderson 📚

I’ve come to expect a pattern with Sanderson’s writing style. Generally, they start with a tease. Something to hook me in and wonder, “What was that all about?” Then it’s Exposition City, as I learn about the world, its history, its magic, the characters and their motivations.  There is ample time provided to become comfortable in this new reality.

Then, somewhere around 60% through, something breaks.

Maybe it’s a character I thought I could trust showing their true allegiance, or a rule of the magic system being broken, or plans completely falling apart. Whatever it is, the world is now completely different. I wonder about it just as the characters do, searching for the actual **truth**. [^1]

I think that’s what’s kept me interested in these books. I love going down Wikipedia rabbit trails, or wondering about something and then researching the heck out of it. So when an author offers the promise of hidden knowledge I have no choice but to continue. I felt this watching _Lost_, or more recently _Severance_.

Sanderson’s strength, though, is on delivering on his promise. _Lost’s_ truth was underwhelming. _Mistborn’s_ truth is **transcendent**. There were times when I audible gasped, or pumped my fist in the air. Either I had an inkling of what would come to pass and been confirmed, or I had been absolutely blindsided. In either case, it’s simply exhilarating.

I am going to take a break from the Cosmere series while I read some books either lent to me or that I purchased and feel obligated to read. But I’m looking forward to returning to this wider universe soon.

[^1]:	That’s most apparent in _Hero of Ages_, as Sazed’s character is explicitly searching for the truth of the world they inhabit. But even in his final revelation, it’s uncertain if the complete truth has been known.
