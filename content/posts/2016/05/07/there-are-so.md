There are so many elderly people that hike around the mountains in Switzerland, it's not even funny. You'll hike out to the middle of nowhere and turn a corner and all of a sudden there's a little cafÃ© with the whole old folk squad just chillin' talking about their grandkids. It's dumb. But also awesome.
