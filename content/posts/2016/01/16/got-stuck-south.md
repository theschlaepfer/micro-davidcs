Got stuck south on Highway One cause of a landslide (we drove under it while it was unstable, yay adrenaline). Ended up having to drive down to Cambria and back up on 101. But it was genuinely fun. Sometimes the wrenches in your plans can end up making a more interesting outing than you had planned to have initially, y'know? Embrace the delays.
