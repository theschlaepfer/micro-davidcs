Anna has the most empathetic heart I've ever known. She sees your sadness and is sad with you. She sees your happiness and magnifies it like a kaleidoscope. When you're upset or stressed out or anxious she sees that and she understands you deeply. This joy she brings through this gift can turn any bad day into a good one, and any good day into a great one.
.
She is perhaps my favorite person in the world, and I am so thankful that she's a part of my life.
.
Here's to one trip around the sun, and to the many more yet to come.
